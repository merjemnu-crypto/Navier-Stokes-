# Solving the Navier Stokes Equation on different geometries

In this project, the NS equation was tackeled from three different ways:
1. JAcobi Iteration for Open lid Cavity: By using the SIMPLE update algorithm and the CFL condition
2. Spectral methods/ FFt Based Method for Open Lid Caivity: 
FFT lets us hande the entire field globally in frequency space
3. Using Solvere (Nektar ++) for Circular Obstacle: here Nektar ++ was used to generate .vtu files which were used for fither analytical and numerical examination
